Adding a new virtual host
Alright, let’s create a new virtual host. Start by creating the directories for your new site. You can put the directories anywhere you want, but the convention for Ubuntu is that web sites belong in /var/www, and I recommend following that convention. Let’s create a folder for the domain that contains an htdocs folder for the web site and a logs folder for the logs.

sudo mkdir /var/www/yourdomain.com
sudo mkdir /var/www/yourdomain.com/htdocs
sudo mkdir /var/www/yourdomain.com/logs
Now, create a new file in the sites-available directory:

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/yourdomain.com
And paste in this virtual host config:

<VirtualHost *>
 
        ServerName yourdomain.name
        ServerAlias www.yourdomain.name
        ServerAdmin webmaster@yourdomain.com
 
        DocumentRoot /var/www/yourdomain.com/htdocs
 
        <Directory />
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride All
        </Directory>
 
        <Directory /var/www/yourdomain.com/htdocs>
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride All
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
        </Directory>
 
        CustomLog /var/www/yourdomain.com/logs/access.log combined
        ErrorLog /var/www/yourdomain.com/logs/error.log
        LogLevel warn
 
</VirtualHost>
Now you just enable the site:

sudo a2ensite yourdomain.com
And reload Apache:

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
That’s it. You can do all kinds of crazy configuration in the virtual host, but that template is enough to get your site up and running. If your DNS is set up right you should be able to hit your domain in a browser and see whatever is in /var/www/yourdomain.com.
