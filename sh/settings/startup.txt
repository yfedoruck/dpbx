To run a daemon or any command as root before login, add it to /etc/rc.local or add a cron job with @reboot as its time field. You can also write a proper init script based on /etc/init.d/skeleton.
To run a command after login, add it to ~/.bash_profile (provided you're using bash). Contrary to ~/.bashrc, this file will be executed by login shells only.
To run a command after login of any new user, add an appropriate .bash_profile to /etc/skel and new users will get this file automatically on account creation.
