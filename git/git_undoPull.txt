*** Undo git pull, how to bring repos to old state ***

> 142 git pull will do two things: it does a git fetch and then a git merge where it merges branches that have been setup to be merged in your config.
      So what you want to do is to undo the merge (undoing the fetch doesn't make a lot of sense and shouldn't be necessary).
      To do that you can try using git reset --hard to reset to a previous state. Use the git-reflog command to find the SHA-1 of the previous state and then reset to it.

> 55    An excellent way to pick the previous state, instead of using git-reflog and copying hashes, is to use a shortcut like master@{1}, which is the previous position of master, master@{"5 minutes ago"}, or master@{14:30}. Full details on specifying revisions in this way can be found in man git-rev-parse, in the section called "specifying revisions". – Jefromi Aug 3 '09 at 17:16
